  <h4 class="text-center text-head">What is the purpose of local SEO?</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 20px;">Any company with a physical place where clients can be greeted or who covers a certain local regional region qualifies for local SEO.
    Local SEO can be used for local brick-and-mortar establishments such as restaurants, hotels, laundromats, physicians' offices, law offices, and convenience stores.

  <h4 class="text-center text-head">Local SEO's Advantages</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 20px;">As we've just seen, local SEO is critical for attracting buyers and conversions for local businesses, whether they're an auto shop in London or a furniture store in Surrey.
    In today's world of internet shopping and supermarket behemoths like Walmart and Amazon, I imagine small business owners are unmotivated to battle for search results with the likes of Walmart and Amazon.
    Local SEO, fortunately for you, will assist you. Local SEO supports local companies over large corporations like Amazon every time!
    Investing in local SEO gives you the opportunity to be discovered by local customers who are ready and eager to invest in your business.
    The importance of small companies is recognized by both Google and the general public. In reality, Google uses a particular collection of local ranking criteria to decide whether or not your company is geographically important to a consumer conducting a "near me" search (we'll go through this in more depth later).
    That means you won't have to compete with big multinational companies to bring your small company in front of the right customers in your region.

  <h4 class="text-center text-head">Start using SEO now</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 20px;">You should start focusing on signals that can maximize your site's digital footprint in the local-driven search environment now that you have a deeper understanding of SEO basics and how Google rates local search results. As a consequence, the company can appear higher on the results list, allowing more prospective clients to reach you.
    There are several variables that affect the exposure in these quests, but bear in mind the local quest is always evolving. Semrush's annual survey will help you shape your policy playbook by keeping track of the signs that are becoming more important and which are becoming less important. 
    You'll be able to service more citizens in your geographic region and expand faster once you start improving each critical signal field.
