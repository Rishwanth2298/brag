  <h4 class="text-center text-head">Internet marketing vs. inbound marketing</h4>
  <p>For good cause, digital marketing and inbound marketing are often confused. Many of the same techniques that are used in inbound marketing are used in digital marketing, including email and web material, to name a couple. Both operate to catch prospects' interest and convert them into buyers during the buyer's path. However, the two perspectives have opposing viewpoints on the tool-goal partnership.
    Each tool in digital marketing is evaluated for its ability to convert prospects. A company's digital marketing strategies can include several channels or rely solely on one.

  <h4 class="text-center text-head">Strategies for Digital Marketing</h4>
  <p>While the list of digital marketing tactics is continually changing, the following are some of the more popular strategies used by most businesses:</p>
  <p >
    <strong> <i> No-Per-Click (PPC) Marketing </i></strong><br>
      PPC advertisement is a general concept that refers to any form of digital marketing in which you pay for each consumer that clicks on an ad. Google AdWords, for example, is a form of PPC advertisement known as "paying search advertising" (which we'll discuss in a moment). Facebook Ads are a form of PPC advertisement known as "paying social network advertising". <br>
    <strong>  <i>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</i></strong> <br>
      You will run text advertisements on Google, Bing, and Yahoo's Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). Paid search ads is one of the most effective ways to reach out to those who are specifically looking for a good or service similar to yours. <br>
      <strong> <i> SEO is for "search engine optimisation" (SEO)</i></strong><br>
      You may use search engine optimization (SEO) to attempt to rate pages or blog entries on your web organically if you don't want to pay to be in the SERPs. You don't have to pay for any click, but having a page to rank normally takes a long time and a lot of work (for a more in-depth comparison of paid search and SEO, check out this article).<br>
    <strong>  <i>Paid Advertising on Social Media</i></strong> <br>
    You can run advertisements on most social networking sites, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Snapchat. Paid social networking advertisement is excellent for raising visibility among viewers that are unfamiliar with your business, commodity, or service.<br>
    <strong> <i> Marketing on Social Media</i></strong><br>
    Social media marketing, like SEO, is a free, natural way to advertise your company on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Organically selling the company on social media, like SEO, requires a lot of time and money upfront, so it will pay off in the long run.<br>
  <strong>  <i>Optimization of Conversion Rates (CRO)</i></strong> <br>
  The art and science of optimizing your web customer experience is known as conversion rate optimization (CRO). CRO is more often used by companies to increase conversions (leads, chats, calls, orders, and so on) from their current website traffic.<br>

  <p>Have you ever been to the bottom of an essay and see a page of recommended reading? That's what native ads are all about. Since it uses the material to draw clicks ("you'll never believe what comes next!"), most native ads fall under the category of content marketing. Since the native advertisement is generally blended in with non-paid content recommendations, it may be difficult to spot...but that's sort of the idea.
