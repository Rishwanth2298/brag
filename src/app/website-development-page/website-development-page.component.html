  <h4 class="text-center text-head">Content management scheme that is best in class</h4>
  <p>All of BragTech's websites are built on WordPress, the world's most-used open source content management framework, which is used by companies such as Bloomberg, Microsoft News, Sony, and BBC. About 455 million websites use WordPress, which controls about 45% of all websites worldwide. It's tough, dependable, and scalable, and search engines love it.
    BragTech believes in independence, accountability, and power, but unlike other agencies, we'll never bind you to a proprietary, obscure, or complicated CMS. Since we use WordPress, you'll save money on amendments and changes when the platform goes live and have the ability to run things yourself. There are no unpleasant surprises or annual payments while you use BragTech's CMS.

  <h4 class="text-center text-head">The beautiful mobile-friendly site interface</h4>
  <p>Our websites are one-of-a-kind and designed from the ground up. We'll bring the brand to life with best-in-class technologies and methods in collaboration with our award-winning design team.
    With a completely responsive web design that makes it smooth on mobile, the website can be both users and search engine-friendly. We also develop a suite of up to 15 bespoke icons and graphics to improve interaction across the latest website and to illustrate important pieces of content.
    They can be used on and offline to promote consistency and continuity through your platforms and collateral. These would not only boost the interface, but will also increase dwell time, user experience, and conversions.

  <p>Once the website designs have been approved, our designers will work with our technical and production teams to ensure that each concept is pixel-perfect before going live. We also have two free amendment and input phases during the design process, so you'll be fully satisfied with the artistic result before it goes into marketing campaigns, as part of our collaboration strategy.</p>
